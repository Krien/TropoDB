# Presentation of TropoDB

This directory contains the talk given about TropoDB for the master thesis defense.
It is based on a slightly older version of TropoDB, but is still accurate in most cases (hence the "IN PROGRESS" at the end).
Note that back then the name of TropoDB was ZNSLSM, not TropoDB.
The ".pptx" file is the correct way to view the slides as it respects the animations. It is originally made in Google Presentations with the Vivaldi browser.
In case formatting does not seem right, try this combination. The ".pdf" file is less acurrate, but should work on most systems.
