    I was helped by various people during the thesis. Their help allowed me to set up the resulting database TropoDB and test ZNS devices. I am grateful for their help and would like to express my gratitude. Matias Bj{\o}rling, Dennis Maisenbacher and Indraneel Mukherjee have helped tremendously with setting up benchmarking tooling and explaining them both for ZNS and ZenFS. Nick Tehrany has also aided with benchmarking ZNS, especially for fio and the plots for resets, and additionally has aided with setting up F2FS on ZNS. Maximilian Barger has aided with fio for read operations. Further on, I thank the AtLarge Team at the VU Amsterdam for the feedback that was received during the thesis defense. To continue, I would like to thank Alexandru Iosup for his feedback on both my thesis defense and writing.  Lastly, I would be remiss in not mentioning the help that the supervisor, Animesh Trivedi, has given. Animesh has helped both in setting up the thesis, weekly discussions and aiding with debugging on GNU/Linux.
